## Pre-doctoral

Many top universities have visit days geared towards students interested in pursuing a PhD in engineering or applied science disciplines. These usually take place over a weekend and are almost always all-expenses paid! This is a great way to visit schools that are on your application list without having to bear much of the cost. I encourage every student to take advantage of these opportunities. I did this during my senior year of college which resulted in my strong applications and admissions to some of the top computer science programs in the world! 

The McNair Scholars Program maintains an extensive list [here](https://mcnairscholars.com/campus-visitations/).

## Dissertation

There are not many general workshops that focus on dissertation writing. Instead, many universities offer their own events where students can attend on-campus workshops or seminars on this topic. Most schools will have writing centers or graduate writing courses that students can enroll in.

## Future Faculty Workshops

A lot of schools have their own summer/winter future faculty programs tailored for their own students. For example, Cornell has their [Future Professors Institute](http://blogs.cornell.edu/futureprofs/) but registration for non-Cornell students is $45. Be sure to check if your institution has a similar program, I know there are others at Berkeley, Stanford, etc.
